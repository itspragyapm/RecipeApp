            <h2>15 minute Spicy Korean Noodle Soup</h2>

            <p>This is a quick Korean noodle soup that’s healthy, packs big flavours and will curb your spicy Asian food cravings. The broth gets its flavour from gochujang and kimchi – express passes to flavour! (PS The soup looks far more fiercely spicy than it actually is, but this is not one for kids.)</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kimchi </li>
                <li>Gochujang</li>
                <li>Chicken stock/broth</li>
                <li>Fish sauce</li>
                <li>Ginger and garlic </li>
                <li>Noodles </li>
                <li>Choy sum</li>
                <li>Carrot</li>
                <li>Green onion</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DIY</h3>
            <p><strong>1. sum cutting – </strong>Trim the roots off. Cut into 7cm / 2.5″ pieces then separate the stems from the leafy part. Why? Because we add the stems first as they take longer to cook than the leaves which wilt in literally seconds. So we put them into the pot right at the end.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Kimchi – </strong>Measure out 2/3 cups kimchi and 2 tablespoons of kimchi juice. Press and squeeze the cabbage if needed to extract the juice! We need it for flavour, so don’t be short!</p>
            <p><strong>3. Simmer broth 10 minutes – </strong>Place all the broth ingredients into a saucepan then simmer for 10 minutes to bring the flavours together. I simmer the kimchi cabbage with the broth ingredients to extract the kimchi juices out of it.</p>
            <p><strong>4. sum cutting – </strong>Trim the roots off. Cut into 7cm / 2.5″ pieces then separate the stems from the leafy part. Why? Because we add the stems first as they take longer to cook than the leaves which wilt in literally seconds. So we put them into the pot right at the end.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Cook noodles – </strong>Cook the noodles according to the packet directions while the broth is simmering, then drain.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Assemble – </strong>Place the noodles in a bowl. Then ladle over the soup broth and all the add-ins. Sprinkle with green onions if using then serve!</p>
