            <h2>Everyday Hokkien Noodles</h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/oFjZVXZWe9k?si=wmaY1ltyZQ4Vf0Ou" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2023/05/27/12/35/noodles-8021415_1280.png" alt="Food 5" class="thumbnail"></a>
            <p>I know that I’ve repeatedly bleated about how you can throw “any vegetables you want!” into stir fried noodles. But if speed is of the essence, and you want a good amount of vegetables in your dinner, you do actually need to think about what vegetables are quick to chop, quick to cook, won’t make your stir fry watery, and you know you can get at any grocery store.</p>

            <p> pre-cooking required (like broccoli). Doesn’t take 5 minutes to soften (like mushrooms). And not one of those vegetables you can’t always find (like Asian greens).</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>500g/ 1 lb hokkien noodles , (fridge best) (Note 1)</li>
                <li>350g/ 12 oz chicken thighs (boneless, skinless), cut into lot of thin 0.5 x 3cm / 0.2 x 1.2" pieces (Note 2)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp canola oil (or vegetable, cottonseed, peanut oil)</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves , finely minced</li>
                <li>8 green onion stems , cut into 5cm / 2″ lengths, white part separated from green part (Note 3)</li>
                <li>1 red capsicum (bell peppers) , cut into thin 0.5cm / 0.2″ strips</li>
                <li>3 heaped cups green cabbage , cut into thin 1 x 5cm / 0.5 x 2" strips</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DIY</h3>
            <p><strong>Abbreviated recipe:
</strong> Marinate chicken with 1 1/2 tbsp Sauce. Cook chicken 1 min, add garlic and white part of green onion, cook 1 min. Add capsicum & cabbage, cook 2 min. Add green part of green onion, noodles, sauce, toss 2 min. Serve!</p>

            <strong> Sauce –</strong> Mix the sauce in a small bowl.</p>
            <strong> Briefly marinate chicken –</strong> Toss the chicken with 1 1/2 tbsp of the Sauce. Marinate for 10 minutes while you prepare the noodles and vegetables.</p>
            <strong> Rinse noodles –</strong> Prepare the noodles per the packet directions (soak in boiling water or briefly boil). Drain in a colander then rinse briefly under tap water (Note 8)</p>
            <strong> Sear chicken –</strong> Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat until very hot (mine is 30cm/12", Note 9 re: wok). Add the chicken and toss for 1 minute. Add the garlic and white part of the green onion, then toss for another 1 minute or until the surface of the chicken is sealed (but still a bit raw inside)</p>
            <strong> Cook veg & noodles –</strong> Add the capsicum and cabbage. Toss for 2 minutes until the cabbage is mostly wilted. Add the green part of the green onions, noodles and sauce. Toss for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until the noodles are stained a lovely mahogany colour.</p>
            <strong> Serve - </strong> immediately, sprinkled with sesame seeds and green onion if desired!</p>
